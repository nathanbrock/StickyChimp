# StickyChimp

The new MailChimp site looks very snazzy but I found myself overly fond of how the navigation menu reacts and displays when they assume the user requires it but hides it when not. This is a quick and simple jQuery plugin for that very feature.

## Usage

The menu element you use StickyChimp upon needs to be __position: fixed__.

	$('.nav').stickychimp();
